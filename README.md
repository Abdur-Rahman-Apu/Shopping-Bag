## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- <b>HTML5</b>: For structure and markup.
- <b>CSS3</b>: For styling and making the application responsive.
- <b>JavaScript (ES6)</b>: For implementing CRUD operations and validations.

## üî• Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. **Input Validation for Product Names**:

   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the product name does not start or end with spaces and does not contain digits.
   - **Solution**: Used `regular expressions` to automatically remove digits from the name.

2. **Handling Product Price Input**:

   - **Challenge**: Restricting the product price input to only allow numbers and ensuring no non-numeric characters could be entered.
   - **Solution**: Used `Regular expression` and allowed only numbers greater than zero.

3. **Confirmation Modal for Deleting a Product**:

   - **Challenge**: Providing a smooth user experience by confirming deletions without accidental actions.
   - **Solution**: Added a modal with a confirmation prompt to ensure users don't delete a product unintentionally.

4. **Making the Application Fully Responsive**:

   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the shopping cart is usable across different devices and screen sizes.
   - **Solution**: Used responsive CSS techniques like `flexbox` and `media queries` to adjust the layout on mobile and desktop devices.

5. **Dynamic Toast Messages**:

   - **Challenge**: Displaying toast messages for different actions like add, edit, and delete, and ensuring they disappear smoothly after a timeout.
   - **Solution**: Created reusable toast message components in JavaScript and applied `setTimeout()` to remove them after a short duration.

6. **No Third party library**
   - **Challenge**: Display toast and modal using only JavaScript to build my logic.
   - **Solution**: I implemented toast and modal using only JavaScript.

## üìö What I Learned

1. **Input Validation in JavaScript**:

   - I learned how to effectively use **regular expressions** and string manipulation methods to handle complex validation scenarios such as ensuring that the product name does not start or end with spaces, and automatically removing digits.

2. **Responsive Design**:

   - This project enhanced my understanding of **CSS Flexbox** and **media queries**, allowing me to make the shopping cart fully responsive for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

3. **Toast Messages**:

   - I improved my skills in creating dynamic **toast notifications** in JavaScript, learning how to build reusable components that can be easily triggered for different actions (add, edit, delete) and disappear smoothly after a set time.

4. **JavaScript Event Handling**:

   - I gained deeper knowledge about **event listeners** and how to handle form inputs in real-time, especially when preventing unwanted characters in the price field.

5. **Confirmation Modals**:

   - I learned how to implement a **confirmation modal** for deletion with a smooth user experience, using JavaScript to control the modal's opening and closing logic.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - I practiced handling errors gracefully, such as displaying appropriate messages when users try to submit empty products or invalid inputs.

7. **UI/UX Design Considerations**:
   - This project helped me appreciate the importance of **user-friendly interfaces**, especially in creating seamless interactions for CRUD operations.
